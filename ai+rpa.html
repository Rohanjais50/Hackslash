        Investment in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has been on an upward trajectory since its inception. Along the rise in popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this shows no signs of slowing down.
        RPA and AI are two technologies becoming indispensable assets to organisations. According to Goldman Sachs, global investment in AI technologies could hit $200 billion by 2025. A Deloitte survey also reveals that 53% of businesses are actively exploring RPA solutions. An additional 19% plan to do so in the next two years. <br><br>
        
        Whilst each technology continues to gain traction in its own right, Intelligent Automation (IA) aims to combine these technologies. Using AI in conjunction with RPA will expand and compliment its capabilities and achieve automation objectives with great efficiency and effectiveness. <br><br>
        
        This blog explores how RPA and AI can be combined as well as the benefits, use cases, and challenges of bringing them together.

        <h1>
            How RPA and AI can be combined?
        </h1>
        <p>
        First of all, it’s important to establish a clear distinction between RPA and AI. In the rush for businesses to explore these new areas of innovation, it’s important to understand what they mean so you can utilise them effectively. <br><br>

RPA is how digital workers can execute a business process at high speed and in high volumes, built on rule-based parameters. It’s best suited for relatively simple and linear processes, which are highly repetitive, with limited scope for exceptions. It can also be extremely useful on legacy systems where API integration is not feasible. <br><br>
</p>

<p class="para" id="para2">
    AI is a technology that can ‘think’ for itself and therefore, execute more complex processes autonomously. Processes that need certain amounts of analysis or decision-making, gain from the use of AI. As well as those that use considerable volumes of data. <br><br>

Integrating RPA and AI offers an efficient and simple automation strategy. RPA can handle repetitive tasks while AI can bring in decision-making and analytical capabilities. <br><br>

In particular, this integrated approach can be used to optimise RPA performance. This  includes self-adjusting algorithms, automated auditing and AI-based exception handling. It can also enrich data collection and validation to support AI initiatives.

            RPA on its own is ideal for automating repetitive tasks, reducing the potential for human error.However, in many workflows, exceptions exist where human Intelligence is required

        RPA can greatly redeuce the time to complete certain tasks.Faster process execution improves organisations productivity and agility.This happens both directly and indirectly as a result of freeing up employee time,enabling them to focus on other higher-value tasks.
