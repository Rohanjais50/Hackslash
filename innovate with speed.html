        Artificial intelligence (AI) extends robotic process automation (RPA) and increases business efficiency.
    </h1>
    <p class="para" id="para1">
        Intelligent automation (IA) — an end-to-end intelligent automation solution that combines robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI) — can provide many benefits that aid in the digital transformation of an organization. <br><br>

AI is the perfect complement to RPA, together providing more accurate and efficient automation powered by an informed knowledge base. AI is the process behind the effort to simulate human intelligence in machines, while RPA automates processes that use structured data and logic.

    <h1>
        What is intelligent automation?
    </h1>
    <p class="para" id="para2">
        Intelligent automation (IA) is the combination of AI and automation technologies, such as cognitive automation, machine learning, business process automation (BPA) and RPA. IA capabilities simplify processes. This simplification enables the user to think about the outcome or goal rather than the process used to get that result or the boundaries between applications. <br><br>

The use of intelligent tools, such as virtual assistants and chatbots, equips organizations with key insights that help in automation efficiency and faster response to customers. For example, tools like optical character recognition (OCR) allow paper-intensive industries, such as healthcare or financial services, to automate text analysis and drive better decision-making.

    <h1>
        Uses for intelligent automation
    </h1>
    <p class="para" id="para3">
        There are many uses for IA, all of which ultimately help provide a better customer experience. Some of the uses include the following: <br><br>

<b>Intelligent document processing (IDP): </b>Forms of business data like images, emails and files often appear in an unstructured format. IDP uses IA tools like RPA, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to extract, validate and process that data. <br><br>
<b>Process discovery: </b>IA can help create a complete guide for automating a process using RPA. <br><br>
<b>Streamline workflows:</b> IA can use data to automate workflows for faster, more efficient processes. <br><br>
<b>Production and supply-chain management:</b> IA can be used to predict and adjust production to respond to changes in supply and demand.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Top four ways IA combines AI and RPA to increase business efficiencys
    </h1>
    <p class="para" id="para4">
        Aristotle believed, in reference to human perception, “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” The extension of RPA with embedded AI capabilities epitomizes this statement. AI utilizes information gathered from various sources and feeds that information to tools and products to increase the value of their interactions. RPA provides value in automating processes based on structured data, many of which previously required manual intervention. On their own, each provides value. But the combination of the two (i.e., IA) provides tremendous value in creating solutions that use a technological knowledge base to streamline processes and interactions between applications. The subsequent solutions are faster and more accurate, and contribute to gaining the following four efficiencies: <br><br>

<b>Increase productivity:</b> Automated applications and processes run faster. Automation of applications and processes, plus the automation of decision-making, forecasting and predictions from multiple sources of structured and unstructured data in real time empowers organizations with greater productivity and accuracy in their planning cycles. For example, Deloitte, an IBM customer in the finance industry, recently used RPA to create bots assigned to automate production of monthly management reports. <br><br>
<b>Reduce costs:</b> According to Deloitte, “Executives estimate intelligent automation will provide an average cost reduction of 22%,” although they also found that, “organizations currently scaling intelligent automation say they have already achieved a 27% reduction in costs on average from their implementations to date.” <br><br>
<b>Improve accuracy:</b> The use of both structured and unstructured data and the automation of repetitive processes ensures better decision-making, and less human intervention results in more precise results. An IBM customer in the finance industry recently used RPA to create bots assigned to automate production of monthly management reports. This automation eliminated errors introduced into the process through manual data entry, improving the accuracy of these reports and many others. Also, the use of OCR can help speed up data processing and automate data extraction from many sources. <br><br>
<b>Enrich the customer experience:</b> Organizations that use technology can better understand customers’ needs, communicate more effectively and bring higher-quality products to market. Customers, in turn, are typically more satisfied in their buying experience. GAM, an IBM customer in the asset management industry, used bots to provide first-line customer support and pricing quotations. This optimization dramatically improved the time it took to provide answers to customers questions, improving the customer experience and streamlining the buying process.
