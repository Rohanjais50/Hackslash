        It has become ever clearer that corporate enterprise practitioners must scale intelligent automation. You must also re-establish whether or not you’re on the right path as you plot your course on your intelligent automation journey. <br><br> But you can’t fall behind, so you’ve got to start working with cognitive solutions now. Next generation solutions thirst for your unstructured data — but, by definition — you’re having a tough time identifying that data. And even if you could — those cognitive solutions must learn from your current infrastructure, which needs systems integration. And wasn’t this supposed to be something you could do without IT?!

        The AI & Intelligent Automation Network feels your pain. And so, we’ve asked friends and community members to not only lay out what they’re doing but to provide some feedback on what you can do right now to transform your enterprise before it’s too late.

        Automation and AI are not new, but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do. Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses, contribute to economic growth, and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges.

        Rapid technological progress

    <p  class="para" id="para4">
        Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots, new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check-outs in grocery stores. Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components, including mechanics, sensors and software. AI has made especially large strides in recent years, as machine-learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them. Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines, many involving beyond-human capabilities in computer vision, natural language processing, and complex games such as Go.

    <p  class="para" id="para5">
        These technologies are already generating value in various products and services, and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations, find anomalies in production, identify fraudulent transactions, and more. The latest generation of AI advances, including techniques that address classification, estimation, and clustering problems, promises significantly more value still. An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in annual value, or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques (Exhibit 1).
